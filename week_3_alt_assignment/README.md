# Week 3 Alternative Assignment

This assignment tries to answer some fundamental questions about this course,
now that you are getting your feet wet with node and express.

Questions we'll try to answer are:

- What is a server?
  a server is a machine that receives request and sends response
- Why do we need servers?
  there will be no interaction with client otherwise
- How do web pages work?
  you got dom and styles, and some js to determine the logic
  once you need something from the outer world, web page sends a signal and receives something according to the request
- What is the difference between HTML and JSON?
  html describes structure of a website to browser
  json is a format that can wrap data that is both server and client properly read
- What is JSON good for?
  sending data between server and client
  making sure there will be no mismatch of both ends
